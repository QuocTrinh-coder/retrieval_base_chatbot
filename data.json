            "responses" : ["The use of skin grafts in burn treatment is a common procedure aimed at promoting the healing of deep burn wounds. Skin grafts involve taking a thin layer of healthy skin from one area of the body (the donor site) and transplanting it to cover the burned area. This helps to replace damaged or lost skin, reduce scarring, and accelerate the healing process. Skin grafts are typically recommended for more severe burn injuries, such as second- and third-degree burns, where the outermost layers of the skin are affected. The success of a skin graft depends on various factors, including the patient's overall health, the extent of the burn, and proper postoperative care. Advances in medical technology continue to improve the efficacy of skin graft procedures, offering patients better outcomes and reduced scarring."
