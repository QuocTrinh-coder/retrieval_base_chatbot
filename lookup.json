    "different type of burn" : ["first-degree burns: red, nonblistered skin. second-degree burns: blisters and some thickening of the skin. third-degree burns: widespread thickness with a white, leathery appearance.",
                                "Burns are classified as first-, second-, or third-degree, depending on how deep and severely they penetrate the skin's surface.",
                                "Burn injuries are classified into different degrees based on the severity and depth of tissue damage caused by the burn. The three degrees of burns are: First-degree, Second-degree , Third-degree"],
    "treatment": ["It depends on the level of burn. Most first-degree burns can be treated at home. It's advised to immerse the burn in cool tap water or apply a cold, wet compress. Do not apply ice, butter or ointments to the burn. Cover the burn with a sterile bandage. If blisters form, do not pop them; let them heal on their own",
                        "Healing time for burns can vary widely. First-degree burns usually heal within a few days to a week. More serious burns can take weeks or months to heal.", 
                    "Any burn more serious than a first-degree burn should be seen by a burn specialist at a burn center.",
                    "Some burns may be minor and can be cared for at home, while others require treatment in the hospital. For many patients who have had a burn injury, the physical rehabilitation, scar management and emotional recovery continue long after the skin has healed.",
                    "The treatment of burns depends on the severity and location of the burn. In general, treatment may involve the following: First Aid: The first step in treating a burn injury is to cool the affected area with cool running water or a clean, damp cloth. It is important not to use ice or apply any creams or ointments to the burn, Pain Relief: Over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be recommended to relieve pain and reduce inflammation., Dressings: Depending on the severity of the burn, dressing materials such as gauze, non-adhesive bandages, or special burn dressings may be used to protect the affected area from further damage and to promote healing, Medications: If the burn is severe, antibiotics may be prescribed to prevent infection. Tetanus shots may also be necessary., Wound Care: In severe burns, wound care may involve debridement, a process of removing dead tissue to promote healing. In some cases, skin grafting may be necessary to replace damaged skin., Rehabilitation: Burn injuries can cause scarring and limited mobility. Physical therapy may be necessary to help patients regain function and mobility."

    "causes and evaluation":["Burns occur at home, work, or play during our everyday activities and happen in seconds. These injuries result from: Fire, Electricity, Hot liquids (scalds), Radiation, Hot objects (contacts), Extreme cold (frostbite), Chemicals", 
                                "Anyone with: Partial thickness burns that extend over 10% of the body, Burns involving the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum or major joints, Third degree burns, Electrical burns including lightning injury, Chemical Burns, Inhalation injury, Burn injury in patients with existing medical disorders such as diabetes, heart failure, etc., Any patients with both burns and a traumatic injury, Burned children, Patients who requeir special social, emotional needs or long term rehabilitation",
                                "The legal responsibility for a burn injury would depend on the circumstances of the injury. In general, the person or entity responsible for causing the burn injury may be held legally liable for the damages you suffered."],
    "hospital advise":["Go to your nearest emergency department or call 911. You should also seek medical attention (same day or urgent care) for first- or second-degree burns if the burn is larger than two to three inches or if the burn is on your face, scalp, genitals, hands, feet, or major joints",
                            "Hospital stays are variable, but the national average is one hospital day per percent of the body burned. The burn team works closely with our patients and their support system to provide a safe discharge as soon as possible.",

If you or someone you know has a burn injury, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. The sooner treatment is started, the better the chances of a full recovery.",
                            "A burn center, burn unit, or burns unit is a hospital specializing in the treatment of burns. Burn centers are often used for the treatment and recovery of patients with more severe burns."],
    "first degree":["First-degree burns involve the outer most layer of skin. A very bad sunburn is considered a first-degree burn."],
    "second degree": ["Second-degree burns occur when the second layer of skin is burned. These burns often have blisters and are painful."],
    "third degree": ["Third-degree burns are the most serious and involve all layers of the skin. These burns often cause permanent tissue damage and can be life-threatening."],
    "electrical or chemical":["Any burns caused by electricity or chemicals should be seen by a specialist at a burn center or hospital"],
    "definition of skin graft" : ["skin graft is a thin layer of skin that is taken from an unburned area of the body and used to cover a badly burned area. Skin grafts are most often used for third-degree burns and, to a lesser extent, second-degree burns.",

    "definition" : ["A burn is an injury to the skin from heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, or radiation. A burn can affect our skin, lungs, and whole body. The deeper or bigger the burn, the more serious it can be. All burns — even small ones — can have a big impact on how someone may feel, look or move."],
    "injuries" : ["Thermal burns are the most common type of burn injury, but they are certainly not the only one that leads to serious injuries. Burn injuries can result from a wide range of incidents and situations. Overall, the severity of a burn injury depends on the degree of the burn, the extent of the affected area, and the location of the burn on the body. It is important to seek immediate medical attention for any serious burn injury",
                        "Yes, a burn is a traumatic injury. Trauma is any injury or wound that is caused by a physical force. Burns are caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, or radiation, and they can cause significant damage to the skin and other tissues. The severity of a burn injury can vary depending on the depth of the burn, the size of the area that is burned, and the age and health of the victim.",
                        "A major burn injury would be one that affects the deeper layers of the skin and tissue, such as a second- or third-degree burn. Severe burns can be life-threatening, and can also lead to long-term complications, such as scarring, disfigurement, and disability."

"home treatment" : ["If you have 2nd or 3rd degree burn, please seek medical help immidiately. Now, to effectively treat a first-degree burn, dermatologists recommend the following steps: Begin by cooling the burn, either by immersing it in cool tap water or applying cold, wet compresses for approximately 10 minutes or until the pain diminishes. Apply petroleum jelly to the affected area two to three times daily, avoiding the use of ointments, toothpaste, or butter to prevent potential infections. Refrain from applying topical antibiotics. Cover the burn with a nonstick, sterile bandage, allowing any blisters to heal naturally without popping them. Over-the-counter pain medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can be considered to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. Additionally, protect the healed area from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, or using a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. This precaution is crucial to minimize scarring, as redness may persist for weeks, particularly in individuals with darker skin tones.",

"use of skin grafts in treatment" : ["The use of skin grafts in burn treatment is a common procedure aimed at promoting the healing of deep burn wounds. Skin grafts involve taking a thin layer of healthy skin from one area of the body (the donor site) and transplanting it to cover the burned area. This helps to replace damaged or lost skin, reduce scarring, and accelerate the healing process. Skin grafts are typically recommended for more severe burn injuries, such as second- and third-degree burns, where the outermost layers of the skin are affected. The success of a skin graft depends on various factors, including the patient's overall health, the extent of the burn, and proper postoperative care. Advances in medical technology continue to improve the efficacy of skin graft procedures, offering patients better outcomes and reduced scarring."
